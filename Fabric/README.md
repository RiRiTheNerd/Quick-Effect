# QuickEffect
If a brewing stand, or nether wart is currently unavailable, this mod allows the player to gain short, weak, potion effects by using their ingredients.

For example, right clicking on a Phantom Membrane will result in the player getting a quick, short slow falling effect.

List of ingredients this works for:

- Phantom Membrane (Slow Falling)  
- Scute (Resistance and Slowness)  
- Ghast Tear (Regeneration)  
- Blaze Powder (Strength)  
- Magma Cream (Fire Resistance)  
- Glistering Melon Slice (Instant Health)  
- Rabbit Foot (Jump Boost)  
- Sugar (Speed)  
- Golden Carrot (Night Vision)  
- Spider Eye (Poison)  
- Pufferfish (Water Breathing)

Using a Fermented Spider Eye while effects are active will give the player their corrupted variations, listed here:

- Slowness (Speed & Jump Boost)  
- Instant Damage (Instant Health & Poison)  
- Invisibility (Night Vision)  

Using Redstone or Glowstone Dust will increase the effects time or amplifier respectively

- Redstone (+1 second of effect, capped at 8 minutes)  
- Glowstone Dust (+1 amplifier of effect, capped at 3)
