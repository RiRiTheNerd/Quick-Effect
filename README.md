# QuickEffect
 
If a brewing stand, or nether wart is currently unavailable, this mod allows the player to gain short, weak, potion effects by using their ingredients. Potions will initially last for 10 seconds with an amplifier of 1.

For example, right clicking on a Phantom Membrane will result in the player getting a quick, short slow falling effect. 

List of ingredients this works for:

- Phantom Membrane (Slow Falling)  
- Scute (Resistance and Slowness)  
- Ghast Tear (Regeneration)  
- Blaze Powder (Strength)  
- Magma Cream (Fire Resistance)  
- Glistering Melon Slice (Instant Health)  
- Rabbit Foot (Jump Boost)  
- Sugar (Speed)  
- Golden Carrot (Night Vision)  
- Pufferfish (Water Breathing)  
- Stone (Infested)
- Slime Block (Oozing)
- Cobweb (Weaving)

Using a Fermented Spider Eye while effects are active will give the player their corrupted variations, listed here:

- Slowness (Speed & Jump Boost)  
- Instant Damage (Instant Health & Poison)  
- Invisibility (Night Vision)  
- Weakness (If no corruptable effects are active)

Using Redstone or Glowstone Dust will increase the effects time or amplifier respectively

- Redstone (+1 second of effect, capped at 8 minutes)    
- Glowstone Dust (+1 amplifier of effect, capped at 3)
